Hi, Iâ€™m @UpasnaAgrawal I have created Data-Acquisition-and-data-Wrangling project with three datasets.
We have upload the datasets and analyze them with the help of checking dimension ,head ,columns and tail.
After analysing we have merged the dataset 1 and dataset 2 and worked on merged data.
We have remove unnecessary column with the help of drop na method and worked on null value where we have used mean method to fill null values.
We have Handled and Analyed Multiple Datasets Using Python: Pandas, NumPy, and Seaborn libraries!
we have Concatenate dataset3 with Merged Dataset and named as finaldata.
We have Successfully imported, analyzed, merged, and concatenated three datasets.Handled missing values and outliers effectively.Visualized the data to gain insights.
